    13h30 (45m) 9h30
    New WP install
    New theme (no parent, starter: underscores)
    Page with new Template => homepage
    NB: PrÃ©ciser qu'il faut le faire le plus vite possible (sinon ils le font direct dans WP)

## Alpha 2: Product launch date changed
    14h15 (10m) 10h
    Client wants to be able to change the introduction text and the date
    Watch out for use of the_meta() => go get *only* the key needed instead => get_post_meta()


-- PAUSE --

    > insert, prepare

    14h25 (35m) 10h15
    Add a form with email, name
    NB: Check that they show a confirmation message when the email is saved

    Warning: Using 'name' as a variable in the form bugs WP

    16h (30m) 11h15
    Means: activating featured image (functions.php) [not anymore]
    permissions issues uploading: chgroup chmod (use chmod g+w instead of 775)

    Done: 11h40
    Group who finished first goes around and helps others moving on

-- PAUSE --
    Admin Menu: https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/administration-menus/

## RC 2: Client want to see all details that have been saved
    16h30 - 17h Done. (30m)
    Means: adding a new menu entry in the backend
    Requirements: Add admin menu

## Optional:
    - Add a countdown to the launch date
    - Add a counter of people pre-registered
    - Prepare message when launch date passed
    - Client wants to receive an email when someones leaves his details

## Question
    Where could such a site (WP) be hosted? Free options?
    What solutions could be used to send the newsletter?


## Outcome
    Two ways:
        - deliver quickly maybe spend more time later
        - spend more time, client waits more (at first, maybe less later, but it's a bet)
